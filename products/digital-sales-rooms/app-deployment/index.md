# Front-end App Deployment
This section will show how to make a *Digital Sales Rooms* Front-end App deployment. This is a template built based on Shopware Frontends & Nuxt 3, so we can deploy it as another others Frontend App.

Shopware Frontends can be deployed in multiple ways, depending on the setup you are using. Most likely you will be using either a static hosting service or a server with a Node.js runtime. The different options and approaches are described [here](https://frontends.shopware.com/best-practices/deployment.html).


Alternatively, we will show a best practice for deployment with Cloudflare, and more, in the future.
